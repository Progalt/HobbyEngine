This Engine is a hobby project. I'm using it to learn but also as a showcase.


I've tried to comment the code as well, although that may of failed in some areas. 
The main render function is nicely commented though and it explains some of my choices with it. 

### Main Features

- Deferred Rendering. 

### Running

It is a visual studio solution. Which in hindsight I probably should I've used cmake. I also use vcpkg for libraries. 

Current libraries: 
- SDL2
- Vulkan
- stb
- ImGui
- glm

The Model Converter also uses Assimp.
